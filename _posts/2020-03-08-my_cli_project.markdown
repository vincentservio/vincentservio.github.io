Coming into this project I knew that I would prefer scraping information over using an API. I chose something
that would not only be fun to work on, but would also help me understand how to grab particular
items. I chose to do my something involving my favorite game of all time, NBA 2K.  I began by watching the hour long video tutorial entitled ‘Building a CLI gem walk-through’. Using the IDE
was fairly easy to get started, however due to an inconsistent internet connection I had no
choice but to start my own local environment. Transferring from an IDE to a local environment
had many complications. I had no idea whether I was using it correctly because I had never
used a local environment prior to this.
After building my CLI and having fake information pass through, I felt accomplished
having a working CLI and working local environment. But it was time for me to fill it with actual
data. It took a bit of trial and error to get Pry, Nokogiri, and Uri started. Mainly because it was
hard to determine where to put the requires and have it installed correctly. I believe it was due
to my local environment having some missing components. I found it incredibly difficult
grabbing the information that I modeled in the test CLI. Mostly because the site was set up
where the tables had headers that were creating an issue. This pushed me to go to office hours
to get help navigating through the problem. After being able to single out each table most of
the hard work was completed. Unfortunately, the code I used to resolve this problem contained
too much content. However, I felt it was easier for me to understand and explain if needed.
Besides all of that, I only had a little bit of time left to turn it in, and I didn’t want to, nor had the
time to rewrite my entire code. I took the remaining time to make my CLI more user friendly.
Because I feel a lot of the wording was jumbled and spacing made a big difference for the user
experience.
I worked on this project with another student at a WeWork, however he built his CLI using
an API. So we weren’t much help to each others particular projects, but it definitely helped
when finding bugs in the each others applications while testing.
