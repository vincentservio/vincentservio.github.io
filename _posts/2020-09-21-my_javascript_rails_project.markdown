My second time going through the JavaScript curriculum has been a different experience for sure. As previously mentioned in my blog post, I struggled adapting to the transition from Ruby to JavaScript. Although I understood how to operate JavaScript, I could not clearly dictate or understand what was ‘under the hood’. I was able to build out a project from my review, but I was unable to successfully explain my own code with confidence. Resulting in me retaking the JavaScript curriculum.

              With a general overview of JavaScript, retaking JS was much more informative and fun. I was able to focus more on the details and mechanics behind it with ease. Starting this project was already easier and less stressful than the first time around. Due to my hectic schedule, I decided to build an app to help organize communal household chores. In the app you can add names and assign chores to each name. My biggest problem while coding this was deciding when classes were appropriate and selecting features that made sense. Overall I really enjoyed this project, it made me more excited to create JS projects in the near future.
