When I began my JavaScript project, I felt overwhelmed with the possibilities of what I could create. This project was definitely one of my favorites. However, I struggled getting accustomed to the JavaScript and the many new terms that came along with it. I eventually came up with my idea, Study Buddy. Study Buddy allows you to create flash cards to aid you in your studies. You can create categories, and then create cards within each of your categories to further organize yourself for a better study environment.

              The most difficult part for me was attaching the newly created cards to their respective decks. During a study session I discovered tampering with the dataset. Once I was able to resolve these errors it became more fun to finish up the project.
