For my rails project I decided to build an app called “Talk Show”. Talk Show is an app where users come together and discuss their favorite TV shows. I am not an avid TV watcher but with the current situation, I have definitely come binging new shows. I faced many challenges with this project, but overall I am satisfied with the results.

              I started my app by creating a chart which mapped out how my users would be associate with TV shows through comments. I then used the devise gem to handle my authentications, which was a solid next step. I then created the models for my comments and TV shows. I struggled with the associations, mostly because TV show was spelled slightly different dues to snake case. But the hardest part overall was using omniauth, because the lesson doesn’t explain how to authenticate through devise. So I had to learn devise in order to learn how to make my omniauth work.
